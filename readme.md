# Formula Sheet for Theory of Heat by Prof. Renner at ETHZ in FS23

This repository mainly evolves around the markdownfile [TdW Formula Sheet](<TdW Formula Sheet.md>). 

I suggest using Obsidean to edit the markdown file and add changes.
Then you can export it to typst or latex for further editing by using `pandoc`, currently only the latest version of pandoc supports exporting to typst and the version on `apt` is outdated, so if you are on a debian based system install in manually from their repo.
